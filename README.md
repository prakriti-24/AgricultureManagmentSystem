##PROJECT:Agriculture mangament system

For the project "Agriculture mangament system," a suitable Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model could be the Prototype Model.For this  prototype model,First , it can be designed as a prototype..Then the users can check whether this can be met their requirement.if it can be satisfied with their requirement then it developed.If not satisfied,then it can be modified or changed  considering user expectation.

# STEPS of protype model
## (i)Requirement Gathering:
Identify the key features and functionalities of the Agriculture managment system, including user roles, content delivery, assessment, and user management.

## (ii)Quick Decision:
First,I take decision what i can developed.

## (iii)Buid a prototype:
I build a prototype according my prototype just like  a demo.

## (iv)Customer Evaluation of prototype:
Customer(Agriculturist & farmer) evaluated this prototype.If they satisfied with this prototype
and this prototype can fulfill their requirement. this is  accpeted by customers.

## (v)Refine requirement incorporation customer suggestion
This prototype can not fulfill their requirement,then customers tell them about their requirement.
## (vi)Accepted by customer
If This prototype can fulfill their requirement. this is  accpeted by customers.
## (viii)Design:

## (ix) Implementation
## Agriculturist:     
In our country,many agriculturist invent verity of  crops like rice,jute etc.Their invention can not reached easily  in farmers .Using this development process ,they can do it.Farmers can be know about their invention.Agriculturist can also suggest farmer about their crops cultivation and their cultivation process. 

## Admin:
Admin can communicate between farmer and agriculturist.Here, admin is the media between them.                                                                                                                  

## Farmer:
In this development process,farmer can be solved  any kinds of problems by agriculturist like their cultivating process,how much prestesides they should used,reducing diseases etc.They can also review about their benefit.They can be known about new invented crops and then cultivate following their instruction.If they they get benefit,they can be review also.
