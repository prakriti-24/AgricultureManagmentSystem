## STEPS of protype model
# (i)Requirement Gathering:
Identify the key features and functionalities of the Agriculture managment system, including user roles, content delivery, assessment, and user management.

# (ii)Quick Decision:
First,I take decision what i can developed.

# (iii)Buid a prototype:
I build a prototype according my prototype just like  a demo.

# (iv)Customer Evaluation of prototype:
if farmer and agriculturist accept this prototype and if this prototype fullfill their requirement then we continue our development like waterfal model
